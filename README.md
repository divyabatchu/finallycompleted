# Neighborhood Map (React)



## About 
This is last project of Udacity front end nanodegree. In this project, there is a map and some nearby locations are shown on map using marker. User can also search or filter the location using the sidebar.
This project is made using react , google Apis and some third party apis like foursquare.

## What I learned?
This project contains a lot of work. I have learned react in depth and how its component and state management works under the hood. I get to know about google apis and how to fetch data from third party api using `fetch` api of browser.
The main concepts are given below:-  
 * React 
 * State Management
 * Google apis
 * Foursquare api for place details

## Install
* `npm` install 
                     
## How to run?

* Run development server:-
  * If you used `npm` in previous step:-
  ```bash
  $ npm start
  ```
 
* If browser not opened automatically go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* Now to see the functionality of service worker , build the production code:-
  * Stop the development server using `ctrl+c`
  * Build the production code:- 
  
    $ npm run build
